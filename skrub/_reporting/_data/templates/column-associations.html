        The table below shows the strength of association between the most similar columns in the dataframe.
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cram%C3%A9r%27s_V">Cramér's V</a> statistic is a number between 0 and 1.
        When it is close to 1 the columns are strongly associated — they contain similar information.
        In this case, one of them may be redundant and for some models (such as linear models) it might be beneficial to remove it.

    {% else %}
    No strong associations between any pair of columns were identified by a quick screening of a subsample of the dataframe.
