Process
-------

Going further, we assume you have write-access to both the repository
and the PyPI project page.

.. note::

   It is useful to publish a beta version of the package before the
   actual one.

To release a new version of dirty_cat, here are the main steps and
appropriate resources:

1.  Update ``dirty_cat/CHANGES.rst``. It should be updated at each PR,
    but double-checking before the release is good practice.
2.  Update ``dirty_cat/dirty_cat/VERSION.txt`` with the new version
    number (e.g. ``1.0``).
3.  Update ``dirty_cat/setup.py``
4.  Make a new branch in order to make a PR.
5.  You have to commit the changes with a new tag: the version youâ€™re
    going to push with the commands
    ``git commit -m "Preparing for release 1.0"``, ``git tag 1.0``,
    ``git push --tags``
6.  Next, you will need to install the ``twine`` package with
    ``pip install --upgrade twine``
7.  Build the source with ``python setup.py bdist_wheel sdist``
8.  `Check if today is a good day for releasing <https://shouldideploy.today/>`__
9.  It is advised to first push the version on the test package index
    ``test.pypi.org`` before the official package index ``pypi.org``.
    You can do this with the command
    ``twine upload dist/* --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/``
    This is useful to test if the build done by twine and the push to
    the package indexer is working.
10. Install the new release from the test package index on a dedicated
    environment with the command
    ``pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ dirty_cat``
11. Finally, if that works fine, you can push to the official package
    index with ``twine upload dist/*``
12. It is also good practice at this point to create a new environment
    and try installing and using the library (for example by launching examples).
    Be sure to install it with the command ``pip install dirty_cat==<version>``
    (e.g. ``pip install dirty_cat==1.0``), otherwise some package/env managers
    such as conda might use a cached version.
13. To finish the procedure, create a new release on the GitHub repository.
