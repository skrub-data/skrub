What can skrub do?
------------------

The goal of skrub is to bridge the gap between tabular data sources and machine-learning models.

skrub provides high-level tools for joining dataframes (``Joiner``, ``AggJoiner``, ...),
encoding columns (``MinHashEncoder``, ``ToCategorical``, ...), building a pipeline
(``TableVectorizer``, ``tabular_learner``, ...), and more.
