          pr_message: |
            👋 Hi there! Thank you for your first contribution to skrub.
            We appreciate your effort and look forward to collaborating with you.
            Please make sure to review our
            [contributing guidelines](https://skrub-data.org/stable/CONTRIBUTING.html).

            All PRs should be discussed in an
            [issue](https://github.com/skrub-data/skrub/issues) with the maintainers
            before being opened: this is to ensure that everyone is on the same
            page, and to avoid having multiple PRs working on the same issue.

            If you used coding agents for this PR, please fill the AI disclosure
            checklist.

            The maintainers reserve the right to close PRs that have been opened
            without prior agreement.

            If you have any questions, feel free to ask!
