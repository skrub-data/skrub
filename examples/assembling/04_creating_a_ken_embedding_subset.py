===============================
Creating a KEN embedding subset
===============================

In this example, we will see how to use the full KEN embeddings to create
a sub-set of embeddings that we can use later on.

.. topic:: Note:

    This example is tightly coupled with the example
    `_example_using_ken_embeddings`_.
    It is recommended to read it first.

We will be building a subset of the embeddings about the video game entities.
