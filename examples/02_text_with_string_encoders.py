# text of the tweets as features.

# GapEncoder
# ----------
# First, let's vectorize our text column using the |GapEncoder|, one of the
# `high cardinality categorical encoders <https://inria.hal.science/hal-02171256v4>`_
# provided by skrub.
# As introduced in the :ref:`previous example<example_encodings>`, the |GapEncoder|
# performs matrix factorization for topic modeling. It builds latent topics by
# capturing combinations of substrings that frequently co-occur, and encoded vectors
# correspond to topic activations.
#
# To interpret these latent topics, we select for each of them a few labels from
# the input data with the highest activations. In the example below we select 3 labels
# to summarize each topic.

# for comparison against the original text and vectors above.

# Now that we have an understanding of the vectors produced by the |GapEncoder|,
# let's evaluate its performance in toxicity classification. The |GapEncoder| excels
# at handling categorical columns with high cardinality, but here the column consists
# of free-form text. Sentences are generally longer, with more unique ngrams than
# high cardinality categories.
#
# To benchmark the performance of the |GapEncoder| against the toxicity dataset,
# we integrate it into a |TableVectorizer|, as introduced in the
# :ref:`previous example<example_encodings>`,
# and create a |pipeline| by appending a |HistGradientBoostingClassifier|, which
# consumes the vectors produced by the |GapEncoder|.
#
# We set ``n_components`` to 30; however, to achieve the best performance, we would
# need to find the optimal value for this hyperparameter using either |GridSearchCV|
# or |RandomizedSearchCV|. We skip this part to keep the computation time for this
# example small.
#
# Recall that the ROC AUC is a metric that quantifies the ranking power of estimators,
# where a random estimator scores 0.5, and an oracle —providing perfect predictions—
# scores 1.

# on very large datasets.
#
# |TextEncoder| enables you to integrate any Sentence Transformer model from the

# column in a dataframe. By default, |TextEncoder| uses the e5-small-v2 model.

# The black points represent the average time to fit and AUC for each vectorizer,
# and the width of the bars represents one standard deviation
#
# The green outlier dot on the right side of the plot corresponds to the first time
# the Sentence Transformers model was downloaded and loaded into memory.
# During the subsequent cross-validation iterations, the model is simply copied,
# which reduces computation time for the remaining folds.
#
# Conclusion
# ----------
# In conclusion, |TextEncoder| provides powerful vectorization for text, but at
# the cost of longer computation times and the need for additional dependencies,
# such as torch.
