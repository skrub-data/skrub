Dirty categories: machine learning with non normalized strings
==============================================================

Including strings that represent categories often calls for much data
preparation. In particular categories may appear with many morphological
variants, when they have been manually input or assembled from diverse
sources.

Here we look at a dataset on wages [#]_ where the column *Employee
Position Title* contains dirty categories. On such a column, standard
categorical encodings leads to very high dimensions and can lose
information on which categories are similar.

We investigate various encodings of this dirty column for the machine
learning workflow, predicting the *Current Annual Salary* with gradient
boosted trees. First we manually assemble a complex encoder for the full
dataframe, after which we show a much simpler way, albeit with less fine
control.

# The data
# --------
#
# We first retrieve the dataset:
from dirty_cat.datasets import fetch_employee_salaries

employee_salaries = fetch_employee_salaries()

# %%
# X, the input data (descriptions of employees):
X = employee_salaries.X
X

# %%
# and y, our target column (the annual salary)
y = employee_salaries.y
y.name

# %%
# Now, let's carry out some basic preprocessing:
import pandas as pd

X["date_first_hired"] = pd.to_datetime(X["date_first_hired"])
X["year_first_hired"] = X["date_first_hired"].apply(lambda x: x.year)
# Get a mask of the rows with missing values in "gender"
mask = X.isna()["gender"]
# And remove them
X.dropna(subset=["gender"], inplace=True)
y = y[~mask]

# %%
#
# Assembling a machine-learning pipeline that encodes the data
# ------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The learning pipeline
# ---------------------
#
# To build a learning pipeline, we need to assemble encoders for each
# column, and apply a supervised learning model on top.

# %%
# The categorical encoders
# ........................
#
# An encoder is needed to turn a categorical column into a numerical
# representation
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder

one_hot = OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown="ignore", sparse=False)

# %%
# We assemble these to apply them to the relevant columns.
# The |ColumnTransformer| is created by specifying a set of transformers
# alongside with the column names on which each must be applied

from sklearn.compose import make_column_transformer

encoder = make_column_transformer(
    (one_hot, ["gender", "department_name", "assignment_category"]),
    ("passthrough", ["year_first_hired"]),
    # Last but not least, our dirty column
    (one_hot, ["employee_position_title"]),
    remainder="drop",
)

# %%
# Pipelining an encoder with a learner
# ....................................
#
# We will use a |HGBR|,
# which is a good predictor for data with heterogeneous columns
# (we need to require the experimental feature for scikit-learn versions
# earlier than 1.0)
from sklearn.experimental import enable_hist_gradient_boosting

# We can now import the |HGBR| from ensemble
from sklearn.ensemble import HistGradientBoostingRegressor

# We then create a pipeline chaining our encoders to a learner

from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline

pipeline = make_pipeline(encoder, HistGradientBoostingRegressor())

# %%
# The pipeline can be readily applied to the dataframe for prediction
pipeline.fit(X, y)

# %%
# Dirty-category encoding
# -----------------------
#
# The |OneHotEncoder| is actually not well suited to the 'Employee
# Position Title' column, as this column contains 400 different entries:
import numpy as np

np.unique(y)

# %%
# We will now experiment with encoders specially made for handling
# dirty columns

from dirty_cat import SimilarityEncoder, TargetEncoder, MinHashEncoder, GapEncoder

encoders = {
    "one-hot": one_hot,
    "similarity": SimilarityEncoder(),
    "target": TargetEncoder(handle_unknown="ignore"),
    "minhash": MinHashEncoder(n_components=100),
    "gap": GapEncoder(n_components=100),
}

# %%
# We now loop over the different encoding methods,
# instantiate a new |Pipeline| each time, fit it
# and store the returned cross-validation score:

from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

all_scores = dict()

for name, method in encoders.items():
    encoder = make_column_transformer(
        (one_hot, ["gender", "department_name", "assignment_category"]),
        ("passthrough", ["year_first_hired"]),
        # Last but not least, our dirty column
        (method, ["employee_position_title"]),
        remainder="drop",
    )

    pipeline = make_pipeline(encoder, HistGradientBoostingRegressor())
    scores = cross_val_score(pipeline, X, y)
    print(f"{name} encoding")
    print(f"r2 score:  mean: {np.mean(scores):.3f}; std: {np.std(scores):.3f}\n")
    all_scores[name] = scores

# %%
# Plotting the results
# ....................
#
# Finally, we plot the scores on a boxplot:

import seaborn
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(4, 3))
ax = seaborn.boxplot(data=pd.DataFrame(all_scores), orient="h")
plt.ylabel("Encoding", size=20)
plt.xlabel("Prediction accuracy     ", size=20)
plt.yticks(size=20)
plt.tight_layout()

# %%
# The clear trend is that encoders grasping the similarities in the category
# (|SE|, |MinHash|, and |Gap|) perform better than those discarding it.
#
# |SE| is the best performer, but it is less scalable on big
# data than |MinHash| and |Gap|. The most scalable encoder is
# the |MinHash|. |Gap|, on the other hand, has the benefit that
# it provides interpretable features
# (see [example 2])
#
# |
#

# %%
# .. _example_super_vectorizer:
#
# A simpler way: automatic vectorization
# --------------------------------------
#
# The code to assemble a column transformer is a bit tedious. We will
# now explore a simpler, automated, way of encoding the data.
#
# Let's start again from the raw data:
employee_salaries = fetch_employee_salaries()
X = employee_salaries.X
y = employee_salaries.y

# %%
# We'll drop the "date_first_hired" column as it's redundant with
# "year_first_hired".
X = X.drop(["date_first_hired"], axis=1)

# %%
# We still have a complex and heterogeneous dataframe:
X

# %%
# The |SV| can to turn this dataframe into a form suited for
# machine learning.

# %%
# Using the SuperVectorizer in a supervised-learning pipeline
# -----------------------------------------------------------
#
# Assembling the |SV| in a |Pipeline| with a powerful learner,
# such as gradient boosted trees, gives **a machine-learning method that
# can be readily applied to the dataframe**.
#
# The |SV| requires at least dirty_cat 0.2.0.
#

from dirty_cat import SuperVectorizer

pipeline = make_pipeline(
    SuperVectorizer(auto_cast=True), HistGradientBoostingRegressor()
)

# %%
# Let's perform a cross-validation to see how well this model predicts

from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

scores = cross_val_score(pipeline, X, y, scoring="r2")

print(f"scores={scores}")
print(f"mean={np.mean(scores)}")
print(f"std={np.std(scores)}")

# %%
# The prediction performed here is pretty much as good as above
# but the code here is much simpler as it does not involve specifying
# columns manually.

# %%
# Analyzing the features created
# ------------------------------
#
# Let us perform the same workflow, but without the |Pipeline|, so we can
# analyze the SuperVectorizer's mechanisms along the way.
sup_vec = SuperVectorizer(auto_cast=True)

# %%
# We split the data between train and test, and transform them:
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.15, random_state=42
)

X_train_enc = sup_vec.fit_transform(X_train, y_train)
X_test_enc = sup_vec.transform(X_test)

# %%
# The encoded data, X_train_enc and X_test_enc are numerical arrays:
X_train_enc

# %%
# They have more columns than the original dataframe, but not much more:
X_train.shape, X_train_enc.shape

# %%
# Inspecting the features created
# ...............................
#
# The |SV| assigns a transformer for each column. We can inspect this
# choice:
from pprint import pprint

pprint(sup_vec.transformers_)

# %%
# This is what is being passed to the |ColumnTransformer| under the hood.
# If you're familiar with how the latter works, it should be very intuitive.
# We can notice it classified the columns "gender" and "assignment_category"
# as low cardinality string variables.
# A |OneHotEncoder| will be applied to these columns.
#
# The vectorizer actually makes the difference between string variables
# (data type ``object`` and ``string``) and categorical variables
# (data type ``category``).
#
# Next, we can have a look at the encoded feature names.
#
# Before encoding:
X.columns.to_list()

# %%
# After encoding (we only plot the first 8 feature names):
feature_names = sup_vec.get_feature_names_out()
feature_names[:8]

# %%
# As we can see, it gave us interpretable columns.
# This is because we used |Gap| on the column "division",
# which was classified as a high cardinality string variable.
# (default values, see |SV|'s docstring).
#
# In total, we have reasonable number of encoded columns.
len(feature_names)


# %%
# Feature importances in the statistical model
# --------------------------------------------
#
# In this section, we will train a regressor, and plot the feature importances
#
# .. topic:: Note:
#
#    To minimize compute time, use the feature importances computed by the
#    |RandomForestRegressor|, but you should prefer |permutation importances|
#    instead (which are less subject to biases)
#
# First, let's train the |RandomForestRegressor|,

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

regressor = RandomForestRegressor()
regressor.fit(X_train_enc, y_train)

# %%
# Retrieving the feature importances

importances = regressor.feature_importances_
std = np.std([tree.feature_importances_ for tree in regressor.estimators_], axis=0)
indices = np.argsort(importances)
# Sort from least to most
indices = list(reversed(indices))

# %%
# Plotting the results:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 9))
plt.title("Feature importances")
n = 20
n_indices = indices[:n]
labels = np.array(feature_names)[n_indices]
plt.barh(range(n), importances[n_indices], color="b", yerr=std[n_indices])
plt.yticks(range(n), labels, size=15)
plt.tight_layout(pad=1)
plt.show()

# %%
# We can deduce from this data that the three factors that define the
# most the salary are: being hired for a long time, being a manager, and
# having a permanent, full-time job :)
#
#
# .. topic:: The |SV| automates preprocessing
#
#   As this notebook demonstrates, many preprocessing steps can be
#   automated by the |SV|, and the resulting pipeline can still be
#   inspected, even with non-normalized entries.
