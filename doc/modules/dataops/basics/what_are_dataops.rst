What are Skrub DataOps, and why do we need them?
==================================================

Skrub provides an easy way to build complex, flexible machine learning pipelines.
There are several needs that are not easily addressed with standard scikit-learn
tools such as :class:`~sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` and
:class:`~sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer`, and for which the Skrub DataOps offer
a solution:

- **Multiple tables**: We often have several tables of different shapes (for
  example, "Customers", "Orders", and "Products" tables) that need to be
  processed and assembled into a design matrix ``X``. The target ``y`` may also
  be the result of some data processing. Standard scikit-learn estimators do not
  support this, as they expect right away a single design matrix ``X`` and a
target array ``y``, with one row per observation.
- **DataFrame wrangling**: Performing typical DataFrame operations such as
  projections, joins, and aggregations should be possible and allow leveraging
  the powerful and familiar APIs of `Pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org>`_ or
  `Polars <https://docs.pola.rs/>`_.
- **Hyperparameter tuning**: Choices of estimators, hyperparameters, and even
  the pipeline architecture can be guided by validation scores. Specifying
  ranges of possible values outside of the pipeline itself (as in
  :class:`~sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV`) is difficult in complex
  pipelines.
- **Iterative development**: Building a pipeline step by step while inspecting
  intermediate results allows for a short feedback loop and early discovery of
  errors.
