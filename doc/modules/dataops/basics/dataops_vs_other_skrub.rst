.. _dataops_vs_other_skrub:

How do Skrub DataOps differ from other Skrub objects?
=====================================================

Skrub DataOps are built to maximize flexibility in the construction of complex
pre-processing and machine learning pipelines. On the other hand, the main intent
of Skrub objects such as :func:`~skrub.tabular_pipeline` and
:class:`~skrub.TableVectorizer` is to provide interfaces that for common
pre-processing tasks, and simple and robust baselines for
machine learning.
