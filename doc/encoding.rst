Encoding: creating feature matrices

Encoding or vectorizing creates numerical features from the data,
converting dataframes, strings, dates... Different encoders are suited
for different types of data.

Encoding string columns
-------------------------

Non-normalized entries and dirty categories
............................................

String columns can be seen categories for statistical analysis, but
standard tools to represent categories fail if these strings are not
normalized into a small number of well-identified form, if they have
typos, or if there are too many categories.

Skrub provides encoders that represent well open-ended strings or dirty
categories, eg to replace :class:`~sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder`:

* :class:`GapEncoder`: infers latent categories and represent the data on
  these. Very interpretable, sometimes slow

* :class:`MinHashEncoder`: a very scalable encoding of strings capturing
  their similarities. Particularly useful on large databases and well
  suited for learners such as trees (boosted trees or random forests)

* :class:`SimilarityEncoder`: a simple encoder that works by representing
  strings similarities with all the different categories in the data.
  Useful when there are a small number of categories, but we still want
  to capture the links between them (eg: "west", "north", "north-west")

Text with diverse entries
...........................

When strings in a column are not dirty categories, but rather diverse
entries of text (names, open-ended or free-flowing text) it is useful to
use language models of various sizes to represent string columns as embeddings.
Depending on the task and dataset, this approach may lead to significant improvements
in the quality of predictions, albeit with potential increases in memory usage and computation time.

Skrub integrates these language models as scikit-learn transformers, allowing them
to be easily plugged into :class:`TableVectorizer` and
:class:`~sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline`.

These language models are pre-trained deep-learning encoders that have been fine-tuned
specifically for embedding tasks. Note that skrub does not provide a simple way to
fine-tune language models directly on your dataset.

.. warning::

    These encoders require installing additional dependencies around torch.
    See the "deep learning dependencies" section in the :ref:`installation_instructions`
    guide for more details.

With :class:`TextEncoder`, a wrapper around the `sentence-transformers <https://sbert.net/>`_
package, you can use any sentence embedding model available on the HuggingFace Hub
or locally stored on your disk. This means you can fine-tune a model using
the sentence-transformers library and then use it with the :class:`TextEncoder`
like any other pre-trained model. For more information, see the
`sentence-transformers fine-tuning guide <https://sbert.net/docs/sentence_transformer/training_overview.html#why-finetune>`_.

Encoding dates
---------------

The :class:`DatetimeEncoder` encodes date and time: it represent them as
time in seconds since a fixed date, but also added features useful to
capture regularities: week of the day, month of the year...
