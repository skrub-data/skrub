Assembling: joining multiple tables
====================================

.. currentmodule:: skrub

Assembling is the process of collecting and joining together tables. 
Good analytics requires including as much information as possible,
often from different sources.

skrub allows you to join tables on keys of different types
(string, numerical, datetime) with imprecise correspondence.

Fuzzy joining tables
---------------------

Joining two dataframes can be hard as the corresponding keys may be different.

The :func:`fuzzy_join` uses similarities in entries to join tables on one or more
related columns. Furthermore, it choose the type of fuzzy matching used
based on the column type (string, numerical or datetime).
It also outputs a similarity score, to single out bad matches, so that they can be
dropped or replaced.

In sum, equivalent to :func:`pandas.merge`, the :func:`fuzzy_join` 
has no need for pre-cleaning.


Joining external tables for machine learning
--------------------------------------------

Joining is straigthforward for two tables because you only need to identify
the common key.

In addition, skrub also enable more advanced analysis:

- :class:`Joiner`: fuzzy-join multiple external tables using a scikit-learn 
  transformer, which can be used in a scikit-learn :class:`~sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline`.
  Pipelines are useful for cross-validation and hyper-parameter search, but also
  for model deployment.

- :class:`AggJoiner`: instead of performing 1:1 joins like Joiner, AggJoiner performs 1:N 
  joins. It aggregate external tables first, then join them on the main table.

- :class:`AggTarget`: in some settings, one can derive powerful features from 
  the target `y` itself. AggTarget aggregates the target without risking data 
  leakage, then join the result back on the main table, similar to AggJoiner.


Going further: embeddings for better analytics
----------------------------------------------

Data collection comes before joining, but is also an
essential process of table assembling.
Although many datasets are available on the internet, it is not
always easy to find the right one for your analysis.

skrub has some very helpful methods that gives you easy
access to embeddings, or vectorial representations of an entity,
of all common entities from Wikipedia. 
You can use :func:`datasets.get_ken_embeddings` to search for the right
embeddings and download them.

Other methods, such as :func:`datasets.fetch_world_bank_indicator` to
fetch data of a World Bank indicator can also help you retrieve
useful data that will be joined to another table.
