Building a robust machine-learning pipeline
===========================================

Skrub provides two objects that combine the transformers described up to this point
to execute reliable and powerful feature engineering (with the |TableVectorizer|),
and to build a full machine-learning pipeline with good defaults that can be
used as a robust pipeline for most use cases (|tabular_pipeline|).

This section describes the usage of both objects.
